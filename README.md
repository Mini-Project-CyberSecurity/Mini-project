# Server Security in Cloud Computing using Block Chaining Technique 
In todayâ€™s digital landscape, cloud computing has become the backbone of modern applications and data storage. However, with its growing adoption comes increasing concerns about security, particularly in ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data stored on centralized cloud servers. Traditional cloud architectures often rely on single points of failure, making them vulnerable to breaches, data tampering, and unauthorized access.

Blockchain technology offers a revolutionary solution to these challenges by introducing decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent systems. In a blockchain-enabled environment, data and processes are distributed across multiple nodes, eliminating reliance on a single entity and reducing the risks of centralized failures. The use of cryptographic techniques, consensus mechanisms, and immutable records provides a robust layer of security, ensuring data integrity and protecting sensitive information.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to overcome the challenges associated with centralized image storage and sharing by developing a Decentralized Image Upload and Sharing System using blockchain technology. The key issues addressed are:

**Security Risks**:Centralized services are prone to data breaches and unauthorized access. Decentralizing storage with IPFS and using blockchain for access control ensures secure, tamper-resistant storage.

**Loss of User Control**: Traditional cloud services require users to trust third-party providers with their data. Our system gives users complete control over who can access their images through blockchain-based smart contracts.

**Lack of Transparency**: Centralized platforms lack transparency. By using blockchain, all transactions related to image uploads and access control are verifiable, creating an immutable audit trail that fosters trust.

**Centralized Failures**: Reliance on a single server can result in outages. With IPFS and blockchain, the system is decentralized and resilient, ensuring continuous availability even in case of node failures.

This project provides a secure, transparent, and user-controlled alternative to traditional cloud-based storage solutions.

## Key Features:
Decentralized Security: Blockchain creates a distributed ledger across multiple servers, ensuring transparency and minimizing the risk of a single point of failure.

Data Integrity: Each block in the chain contains cryptographic hashes of the previous blocks, making it nearly impossible to alter or tamper with the data stored on the server.

Access Control: Blockchain enables a secure authentication mechanism, where user identities are verified, and access permissions are recorded immutably.

Traceability: Every transaction and interaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing a complete audit trail that helps in identifying and preventing unauthorized activities.

Resilience to Attacks: Blockchain's consensus mechanism ensures that even if some nodes in the network are compromised, the integrity of the data remains intact.


## Technologies Used:
Cloud Computing Platform: To simulate server environments.

Blockchain Framework: Implementing a distributed ledger for server security.

Cryptographic Algorithms: For securing data and transactions.

Smart Contracts: To automate and enforce security policies.
