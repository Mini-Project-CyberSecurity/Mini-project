# Server Security in Cloud Computing using Block Chaining Technique 
Cloud computing offers convenience but poses security risks due to centralized data storage. 
Blockchain addresses these challenges by providing decentralized, tamper-proof, and secure systems, ensuring data integrity and protection through cryptographic techniques and consensus mechanisms.

## Objective:
Strengthen cloud server security by utilizing blockchain's decentralized and immutable structure.

Provide a secure and efficient way to manage server access and data integrity.

Reduce the risk of server breaches and unauthorized access through a blockchain-based approach.

## Key Features:
Decentralized Security: Blockchain creates a distributed ledger across multiple servers, ensuring transparency and minimizing the risk of a single point of failure.

Data Integrity: Each block in the chain contains cryptographic hashes of the previous blocks, making it nearly impossible to alter or tamper with the data stored on the server.

Access Control: Blockchain enables a secure authentication mechanism, where user identities are verified, and access permissions are recorded immutably.

Traceability: Every transaction and interaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing a complete audit trail that helps in identifying and preventing unauthorized activities.

Resilience to Attacks: Blockchain's consensus mechanism ensures that even if some nodes in the network are compromised, the integrity of the data remains intact.


## Technologies Used:
Cloud Computing Platform: To simulate server environments.

Blockchain Framework: Implementing a distributed ledger for server security.

Cryptographic Algorithms: For securing data and transactions.

Smart Contracts: To automate and enforce security policies.

## Architecture:
