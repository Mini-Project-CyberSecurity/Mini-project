# Server Security in Cloud Computing using Block Chaining Technique 
This project focuses on enhancing server security in cloud computing environments by leveraging blockchain technology. Cloud computing provides scalable and flexible infrastructure, but it also introduces security vulnerabilities such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and cyber-attacks. This project addresses these challenges by implementing a decentralized security model through block chaining.

## Objective:
Strengthen cloud server security by utilizing blockchain's decentralized and immutable structure.

Provide a secure and efficient way to manage server access and data integrity.

Reduce the risk of server breaches and unauthorized access through a blockchain-based approach.

## Key Features:
Decentralized Security: Blockchain creates a distributed ledger across multiple servers, ensuring transparency and minimizing the risk of a single point of failure.

Data Integrity: Each block in the chain contains cryptographic hashes of the previous blocks, making it nearly impossible to alter or tamper with the data stored on the server.

Access Control: Blockchain enables a secure authentication mechanism, where user identities are verified, and access permissions are recorded immutably.

Traceability: Every transaction and interaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing a complete audit trail that helps in identifying and preventing unauthorized activities.

Resilience to Attacks: Blockchain's consensus mechanism ensures that even if some nodes in the network are compromised, the integrity of the data remains intact.


## Technologies Used:
Cloud Computing Platform: To simulate server environments.

Blockchain Framework: Implementing a distributed ledger for server security.

Cryptographic Algorithms: For securing data and transactions.

Smart Contracts: To automate and enforce security policies.
